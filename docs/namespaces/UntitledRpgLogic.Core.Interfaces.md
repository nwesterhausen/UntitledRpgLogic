# UntitledRpgLogic.Core.Interfaces

Contains interfaces for all core components of the RPG logic, including game entities, actions, and systems. 

These are the contracts that define the various components used throughout UntitledRpg. They allow for new implementations to be created
and integrated without modifying existing code, promoting flexibility and extensibility in the game's architecture.
